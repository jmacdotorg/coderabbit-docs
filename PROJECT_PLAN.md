# Project Plan for Code Enhancements

This document outlines the steps to enhance the project with several improvements across different areas of the codebase.

## 1. Internationalization (i18n) for FizzBuzz

**Objective:** Update the fizzboop/fizzbuzz.py file to support multiple languages.

**Steps:**
- Import the built-in `gettext` module.
- Initialize the translation system by adding:
  ```python
  import gettext
  t = gettext.translation('fizzbuzz', localedir='locales', fallback=True)
  _ = t.gettext
  ```
- Wrap all user-facing string literals (e.g., in print statements: "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz") with the translation function `_()`. For example:
  ```python
  print(_("Fizz"))
  ```
- Create a `locales` directory in the project root with subdirectories for each target locale (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`).
- Generate and manage a template `.po` file for translators, and provide instructions for compiling these into `.mo` files for runtime usage.

## 2. Redis Caching for FizzBuzz

**Objective:** Enhance performance by caching results of the FizzBuzz computation.

**Steps:**
- Verify if Redis is already imported; if not, add:
  ```python
  import redis
  redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
  ```
- Within the fizzbuzz function, generate a unique cache key based on the input `n`.
- Before processing, check if a cached output exists:
  - If a cached result is found, retrieve and print it.
  - If not, compute the fizzbuzz output, cache the result using `setex()` with an expiration time (e.g., 3600 seconds), and then print it.
- Add logging to capture any caching errors.

## 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**Objective:** Replace bare `except:` clauses with explicit exception handling for improved error clarity.

**Steps:**
- Search for all instances of bare `except:` clauses across the codebase.
- Analyze each usage to determine the specific exception(s) that should be caught (e.g., `ValueError`, `IOError`).
- Update the code to explicitly catch these exceptions. For instance, replace:
  ```python
  except:
  ```
  with:
  ```python
  except ValueError:
  ```
  or:
  ```python
  except (IOError, OSError):
  ```
- Include inline comments explaining the chosen exception types.
- Validate changes with tests to ensure proper error reporting.

## 4. Update Parser Usage

**Objective:** Replace the deprecated tokenizer from otherParser with `bobFinkling` from yetAnotherParser.

**Steps:**
- Locate all import statements and usages of the old tokenizer in the codebase (e.g., within example/bob.py).
- Change the import statement from:
  ```python
  import tokenize, parse, atom from otherParser
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  from yetAnotherParser import bobFinkling
  ```
- Update all usages of the old tokenizer to use `bobFinkling` instead.
- Perform tests with sample inputs to confirm the new parser functionality is working as expected.

## 5. Testing

& Documentation

**Objective:** Ensure that all enhancements function correctly and update the project documentation accordingly.

**Steps:**
- Execute unit tests and manual tests covering:
  - Internationalization changes in fizzboop/fizzbuzz.py.
  - Redis caching functionality.
  - Revised error handling modifications.
  - Parser usage updates.
- Update README.md or other relevant documentation to include:
  - Instructions for adding new locales and compiling translation files.
  - An explanation of the caching strategy and how to troubleshoot it.
  - Details about the parser changes with `bobFinkling` integration.
